            <h4>Log Files</h4>
            <p>Golden Rose follows a set of protocols and standard procedure of using log files. These files hold
                the
                information about the users when they visit websites. All web-hosting companies do this process as a
                part of hosting services' analytics.
                The information collected by log files includes IP addresses, search engine name, browser type, ISP,
                date and time stamp, referring/exit pages, and heatmap. These are not linked to any personally
                identifiable information. The purpose
                of the log files is to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movement on the website,
                and
                gather demographic information.</p>

            <h4>User Input</h4>
            <p>When a user provides input on our websites such as name, email, communication address, mobile number,
                payment details, and other data, we store the info so that we can assist them in the best way. We

                events.

                done
                with their consent, which
                they can withdraw from at any time.</p>

            <h4>Payment</h4>
            <p>We use various Payment Service Providers to process the transactions initiated by the users on our
